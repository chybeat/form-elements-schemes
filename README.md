# Dark and Light schemes in form inputs

Developing... ðŸ˜‡

For now without collabs, but I hope You will contribute because I need:

1. An UI designer for [this page](https://chybeat.github.io/form-elements-schemes), and some form elements
1. An english translator/supervisor (my native language is spanish)
1. Some who has any Apple Inc. Operating system (any version) on any device using safari browser (any version) to test some details.
1. Some who has a computer with Windows 7 or Windows XP and any old version of google chrome or Firefox
1. Anyone using any GNU/Linux distro with any browser

All contributors will have the credits by his/her work in one or more topics in this repository and [humans.txt](https://chybeat.github.io/form-elements-schemes/css/forms-aio.min.css") file

This project has only one motivation, make a little better box model and color schemes for form elements

To use just download the file [forms-aio.min.css](https://chybeat.github.io/form-elements-schemes/css/forms-aio.min.css") and add the `link` tag like in the html `head` tag below:

```css
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/forms-aio.min.css">
```

A lot of .css, .css.min, and .map files of project are located in [css folder](https://github.com/chybeat/form-elements-schemes/tree/main/css) but if you want to explore easily the CSS code, watch SCSS files in [SCSS folder](https://github.com/chybeat/form-elements-schemes/tree/main/scss), specially the files starts with underscore ( \_ ).

## Watch live

[This page](https://chybeat.github.io/form-elements-schemes) shows more detailed information and live samples in dark and light schemes. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
